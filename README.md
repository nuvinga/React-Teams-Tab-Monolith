# React-Teams-Tab-Monolith
> By: [Nuvin Godakanda Arachchi](https://nuvinga.github.io) @ [GitHub](https://github.com/nuvinga)

This repository includes two react-teams tab apps, connected together for functionality sharing, following a monolithic architecture. 
The application is able to share the components of another application (uni-sided), and will automatically reflect any changes happening on the 
core application in the secondary app.
